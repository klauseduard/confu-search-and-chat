# confu-search-and-chat
Wannabe semantic search and chat experiment on top of on-premise Confluence installation.

Please note that I'm not publishing the full pipeline before I'm relatively satisfied with it.

I am publishing parts of it because I intend to use it as an example of what can be accomplished
writing and refactoring code (well, bash and python) with the help of chatGPT (or certain OpenAI
APIs).

Currently available: download and preprocess (break into chunks) of a Confluence page.

Currently missing: embed, store embeddings, embed query, cosine similarity, and next steps I
won't even mention now.
